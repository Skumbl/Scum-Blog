# About Scumble

**Hello**, my “name” is Scumble. I’m a developer who very originally decided to make a blog.

My online name comes from a book by Terry Pratchett. I chose it when I was a high-school freshman, and it just kind of 
stuck as the name I use online, so now you’re stuck with the scum blog.

The projects I work on professionally tend to be very old and very standard development tools, like Java and AngularJS, 
so one of the reasons I made this blog was to give myself a way to practice building something in the JavaScript ecosystem
and learn some new frameworks.

Do I like the JavaScript ecosystem? Not really. But I love to learn, so here we are.
I am also the number-one boilerplate enjoyer—so what do I know.
